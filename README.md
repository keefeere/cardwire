# cardwire
A GPU manager for Linux for laptops and multi-GPU desktops, using eBPF LSM hooks.

> **Downstream fork:** maintained at [keefeere/cardwire](https://github.com/keefeere/cardwire).
> See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for the administrative PID API, atomic process policies,
> independent builds, testing and deployment limitations. This is not an upstream release.

## Benefits
- **Instant App Startup:** Prevents applications (like Electron apps or GTK apps) from attempting to initialize the GPU, this eliminates the 3–4 second "hang" typically caused by waiting for a sleeping GPU to power up
- **Power Efficiency:** By blocking access at the syscall level, the GPU is never woken from its lowest power state (D3cold), extending battery life on laptops
- **Non-Invasive:** Unlike traditional methods that might require driver unloading, risky unbind or complex Wayland setups, this approach is transparent to the rest of the system and easy to toggle
- **Application Forcing:** Launch any app on the GPU you choose with `cardwire launch <APP>`
- **Application Policy (Smart Mode)** Keep the dGPU blocked by default, and gran access only to the ones you allow

## Getting Started

Head to the [docs](https://opengamingcollective.github.io/cardwire) to see how to install and use Cardwire on your system

## Modes
Modes are available depending on your system type:
**Laptop:**
- Integrated
- Hybrid
- Smart

**Desktop**
- Hybrid(kept as a default mode, everything goes back to unblocked)
- Manual

## How it works

Cardwire uses eBPF with LSM hooks to intercept file operations on GPU device nodes, such as `/dev/dri/renderDX`, `/dev/dri/cardX`, sysfs `config`, `nvidiaX` and other GPU-related files.

When a GPU is "blocked," the eBPF program returns `-ENOENT` for any syscall targeting that device, effectively hiding it from apps.
